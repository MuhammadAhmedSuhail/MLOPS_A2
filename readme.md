## Data Processing Guide

### Overview of Data Processing
Effective data processing is fundamental to the integrity of data applications, ranging from analysis to predictive modeling. This guide focuses on the steps involved in processing data sourced from dawn.com and bbc.com.

### Detailed Processing Steps
1. **Data Collection:**
   - Capture specific HTML tags such as `<p>`, `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, and `<h6>` from the pages.
   - Record both the tag type and the text it contains.

2. **Text Clean-up:**
   - Eliminate newline (`\n`) and carriage return (`\r`) symbols to format the text into a consistent, single-line style, which facilitates subsequent CSV formatting and data analysis.
   - Remove extraneous spaces at the beginning and end of the text to enhance data uniformity and analytical accuracy.

3. **Data Structuring:**
   - Transform the extracted content, organized as tuples of tag and text, into a structured pandas DataFrame, offering a robust format for additional manipulation or analysis.
   - Export this DataFrame into a CSV file named `processed_data.csv`, providing a standardized format for subsequent operations like data modeling or reporting.

### Utilized Libraries
- **Pandas**: Essential for DataFrame operations, including data manipulation.
- **Python Standard Library**: Used for managing files and handling regular expressions.

## Data Version Control (DVC) Integration Guide

### Introduction to DVC
Data Version Control (DVC) is a version control system tailored for data science projects, facilitating the management of large data files, datasets, and machine learning models. It enhances model sharing and reproducibility across teams.

### DVC Implementation Steps
1. **Installation:**
   - Install DVC using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install dvc
     ```

2. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize DVC in your project directory:
     ```bash
     dvc init
     ```

3. **Remote Storage Setup:**
   - Set up a remote repository, for example, on Google Drive:
     ```bash
     dvc remote add -d myremote gdrive://<hash-value>
     ```

4. **Configuration:**
   - Configure DVC to recognize and use the remote repository:
     ```bash
     dvc remote modify myremote profile myprofile
     ```

5. **File Tracking:**
   - Begin tracking files with DVC:
     ```bash
     dvc add data/file.csv
     ```
   - Commit the .dvc file that is created to Git to manage data versions.

6. **Data Pushing:**
   - Push tracked data to your remote storage:
     ```bash
     dvc push
     ```

7. **Git Versioning:**
   - Commit and push your changes to your Git repository to ensure all data changes are versioned:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Add changes"
     git push
     ```

### Integration and Collaboration
- **Automation:** Incorporate DVC operations within your data processing scripts or Airflow DAGs to automate the data versioning process.
- **Team Collaboration:** Utilize DVC to maintain uniform data versions across different team members, facilitating consistent development, testing, and deployment environments.
